# Heartbeat Count: Procs, Norms, Training Effects

As a preliminary investigation into interoceptive processing, I conducted a self-experiment to quantify three distinct dimensions of interoception as proposed by Garfinkel et al. (2015)[^1]: *interoceptive accuracy* (objective performance in heartbeat detection tasks), *interoceptive sensibility* (self-reported belief in one’s bodily awareness), and *interoceptive awareness* (metacognitive correspondence between confidence and accuracy).

This framework addresses confusion around how interoception is operationalized and measured. Garfinkel and colleagues showed these dimensions are dissociable and only correlate meaningfully in individuals with high interoceptive accuracy. The aim here is to estimate my performance across these three dimensions and evaluate whether subjective belief and confidence match objective heartbeat perception.

### Materials

- Stopwatch or timer  
- Pulse oximeter or wearable device capable of displaying heart rate in real time  
- Notebook or spreadsheet for logging data  
- Visual analog scale (0–10) for confidence ratings  

### Procedure

#### 1. Heartbeat Tracking (Accuracy Task)

In a quiet, seated position, I performed six trials of silent heartbeat counting using randomly ordered intervals of 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 seconds. For each trial:

a. Close eyes and count perceived heartbeats from “start” to “stop.” 
b. Record estimated heartbeat count.  
c. Compare to actual beats recorded by the wearable device or pulse oximeter.  
d. Compute accuracy using:

$$
\text{Accuracy} = 1 - \frac{|\text{Reported} - \text{Actual}|}{(\text{Reported} + \text{Actual}) / 2}
$$

#### 2. Confidence Ratings (Awareness)

After each trial, rate confidence in the heartbeat estimate on a scale from 0 (pure guess) to 10 (completely certain). Interoceptive awareness is evaluated by correlating confidence with accuracy across trials.

#### 3. Interoceptive Sensibility (Self-Perception)

- Respond to:  
  > “On a scale from 1 to 10, how attuned do you feel to internal bodily sensations in general?”  
- Compute mean confidence across all trials as a task-specific sensibility measure.

### Analysis

- **Accuracy:** Mean accuracy across six trials  
- **Awareness:** Correlation between confidence and accuracy  
- **Sensibility:** Self-rated score and mean confidence  

These metrics assess the alignment between subjective belief, metacognitive confidence, and objective interoceptive accuracy. According to Garfinkel et al. (2015)[^1], meaningful metacognitive awareness typically emerges only above a certain accuracy threshold.
