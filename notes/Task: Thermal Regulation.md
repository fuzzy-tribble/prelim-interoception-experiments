# Thermal Regulation: Procs, Norms, Training Effects

This exploratory self-experiment aims to assess the ability to voluntarily modulate peripheral body temperature (thermal regulation) and to evaluate subjective awareness and control of these changes. Inspired by studies of volitional thermogenesis and thermal biofeedback, as well as anecdotal reports of meditative thermal control[^1][^2], this protocol evaluates both physiological modulation and perceptual sensitivity to symmetric and asymmetric hand warming and cooling.


TODO - symetric procedure will be the 20 minute visualization of liquid sunlight flowing down from the top of the head into the hands or just focus on the hands heavy and warm
TODO - asymemetric procedure will be 20 minute visualization of intense focus on one hand; simultaneously restricted awareness from an adjacent location, directing vasoconstriction.


### Goals

- **Evaluate** the ability to voluntarily induce warming or cooling sensations in the hands.  
- **Examine** subjective confidence and accuracy in reporting thermal changes.  
- **Assess** whether asymmetric thermal perception is detectable.  

### Materials

- IR thermometer or thermal camera for skin temperature measurements (optional but recommended)  
- Timer or stopwatch  
- Notebook or spreadsheet for data logging  
- Dice or random number generator  
- Heat and cold source (e.g., warm pack, cold pack, warm mug, or bowl of cold water)  

### Design and Procedure

Each trial begins with a roll of a 6-sided die to determine the condition:

- **1–2:** Attempt to **warm both hands symmetrically**  
- **3:** Attempt to **cool both hands symmetrically**  
- **4:** Attempt to **warm one hand only** (left or right alternates)  
- **5:** Attempt to **cool one hand only**  
- **6:** **Control condition** — relax and do nothing  

**Each trial lasts 2–3 minutes** and proceeds as follows:

1. Sit quietly with hands resting palms up and relaxed.  
2. Roll a die and begin the condition-specific mental focus (e.g., “warm my left hand only”).  
3. Optionally, place a temperature sensor or IR camera to record finger or palm temperature at baseline and at end of trial.  
4. After each trial:  
   - Rate perceived temperature change in each hand on a scale from –5 (very cold) to +5 (very warm), relative to baseline.  
   - Rate confidence in perception (0 = guessing, 10 = certain).  
   - Note any physical aids used (e.g., breath holding, imagery, attention).  

### Self-Assessment Metrics

- **Perceptual asymmetry:** Difference in self-reported temperature between hands.  
- **Thermal modulation score:** Signed perceived change in temperature from baseline.  
- **Confidence–accuracy alignment:** If objective temperature data are collected, correlate them with subjective perception and confidence.  
- **Condition success rate:** Proportion of trials where direction of perceived change matches instructed modulation.  

### Exploratory Notes

This task investigates whether internal attention can induce thermally perceptible shifts in peripheral regions. Previous research has demonstrated that focused attention or meditative practice can lead to modest but measurable changes in skin temperature[^3].
