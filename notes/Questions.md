# Questions

- Are there any pressure waves that are artifacts or echoes of other pressure waves like heartbeat, etc?
- Is there equipment that detects "chills"? 
- How to distinguish between training/interfacing with these system directly or if its a result of general relaxation, etc? For example heating hands happends as part of a general relaxation response...

- Cross-modal performance: Research indicates that heightened sensitivity in one exteroceptive modality (e.g., tactile) does not necessarily predict heightened sensitivity in another (e.g., visual).

## Other things not explored
Because we have no reason to believe that being good at one modality means you are good at another modality (ie. good auditory exteroception does not predict good visual exteroception) several physiological measures evaluated but noted here for reference:

- Vibrotactile frequency discrimination (tactile exteroception)
- Visual field testing (visual exteroception)

## Predictors of Biofeedback Success

- **Baseline Physiological Measures**: Individuals with greater initial dysregulation may exhibit more noticeable improvements.  
- **Cognitive Factors**: Higher cognitive flexibility and motivation levels are associated with better outcomes.
- **Condition-Specific Factors**: For example, in urinary incontinence treatments, absence of recent urinary tract infections predicts better biofeedback outcomes.[^4]
